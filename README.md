### Update Notes:

```diff
+ refined the workflow and ready for scaling the production of both optical and radar data results
+ improved memory use (by 50%) for autoRIFT and runtime (60x) for GeogridOptical
+ refined NDC filter to accommodate fine grid with spatially overlapping (dependent) search chips
+ parallel computing for NCC
+ support for remote input files using GDAL virtual file systems (e.g., `/vsicurl/https://...`)
+   see: https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html
```


**A Python module of a fast and intelligent algorithm for finding the pixel displacement between two images**

**autoRIFT can be installed as a standalone Python module (only supports Cartesian coordinates) either manually or as a conda install (https://github.com/conda-forge/autorift-feedstock). To allow support for both Cartesian and radar coordinates, autoRIFT must be installed with the InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE: https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2)**

**Use cases include all dense feature tracking applications, including the measurement of surface displacements occurring between two repeat satellite images as a result of glacier flow, large earthquake displacements, and land slides**  

**autoRIFT can be used for dense feature tracking between two images over a grid defined in an arbitrary map-projected Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinate system when used in combination with the sister Geogrid Python module (https://github.com/leiyangleon/Geogrid). Example applications include searching radar-coordinate imagery on a polar stereographic grid and searching Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) imagery at a user-specified map-projected Cartesian (northing/easting) coordinate grid**

## 1. Authors

Alex Gardner (JPL/Caltech; alex.s.gardner@jpl.nasa.gov) first described the algorithm "auto-RIFT" in (Gardner et al., 2018), developed the first version in MATLAB and continued to refine the algorithm;

Yang Lei (GPS/Caltech; ylei@caltech.edu; leiyangfrancis@gmail.com) translated it to Python, further optimized and incoporated to the ISCE software while also developed its sister module Geogrid;

Piyush Agram (GPS/Caltech; piyush@gps.caltech.edu) set up the installation as a standalone module and further cleaned the code.
